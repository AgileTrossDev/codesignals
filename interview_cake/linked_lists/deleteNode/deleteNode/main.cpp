// Lessons learned
//   - Think about the data structure and what is the quickest manipulation that can be done.
//   - Traversing the linkList is slow and should be a redflag there is a better solution.  Also impossible in
//     this case.
//   - Ask ourselves what we know from the input.   Cur Val, Cur Next.   TWo things.
//   - LinkedLists are meant to be fluid in memory.  So deleting should be quick without array sizing.
//   - JUST COPY CONTENTS FROM NEXT NODE TO CURRENT NODE AND DELETE THE NEXT AND NOONE WOULD EVER KNOW.
