// Lessons Learned
//   - Vectors can be treated as LinkedLists if the values are within the range of N and N is
//     less than size of vector
//
//   - Duplicates in the vector turn out to be loops in the link list because they end up
//     pointing to the same location multiple times.
//
//   - In order to find duplicate value in a vector, find the start of the cycle. The node
//     before it will be a duplicate value.
//
//   - The start of the cycle will always have two nodes pointed to it.  In this case,
//     the duplicate values act as pointers to the start of the cycle.
//
//   - Find the start of the cycle by traversing the vector N-times.  The index
//     will definitely be inside the cycle somewhere.   Now iterate around the
//     cycle to obtain the length of the cycle.   Once we have a length, we can use
//     two runners that difference apart.   When they collide, it will be when the
//     second runner first enters the cyle.  Which is the start of the cycle. The leader
//     will be beginning it's second lap.
//
//   - As stated above, the duplicates will be the parent of either runner, which is either
//     node before the start of the cycle.  So track that position and you will find the
//     duplicate values.

    //          difference between two indexes will collide at the start of the loop.
    //          But the trick is that the start of the loop always has 2 'nexts' pointing
    //          to it.  The duplicate is the node before the start of the loop.  Either of
    //          of the two nodes.
